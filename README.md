Method overloading is an example of polymorphism

Polymorphims means one thing with multiple forms.

Polymorphis: 4 rules (method overloading: Method/Constructor overloading)
1)	Method name should be same.
2)	Number of parameters should be different.
3)	Data type of parameters should be different
4)	Order of parameters should be different.
